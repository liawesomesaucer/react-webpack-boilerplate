# React + Webpack 2 + Redux Boilerplate
![Alt text](/boilerplatever2.png?raw=true)

Simple boilerplate that uses all the most up to date dependencies.

## Why create a boilerplate there are so many already?

At SoloMid, we decided to open source a simple, most up to date, beginner-friendly React boilerplate. There are more comprehensive boilerplates out there (e.g. [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate)), however this is the boilerplate that worked for us and includes the most basic needs for a scalable web app. 

## Contains

- [x] [Webpack v2.2.1 (development and production config)](https://webpack.github.io)
- [x] [React v15.4.1](https://github.com/facebook/react)
