# React + Webpack 2 + Redux Boilerplate

Simple boilerplate that uses all the most up to date dependencies.

## Why create a boilerplate, there are so many already?

We noticed that not many contain the latest versions for the below listed dependencies, so we just pushed this out. It's also a great way for beginners to learn bare bones of what's needed for a "production ready" web app.

## Contains

- [x] [Webpack v2.2.1 (development and production config)](https://webpack.github.io)
- [x] [React v15.4.1](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [x] [Redux v3.6.0](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
- [x] [React Router v3.0.2](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [x] [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [x] [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [x] [Hot Module Reloading]
- [x] [Linting]
- [x] [Google analytics]
- [x] [404s]

Make sure you have the latest node version before using Webpack 2.
